# Freezam

NOT YET WORKING.

Freezam is a command line utility for music and audio recognition from a large database of files. To begin using freezam, run `python setup.py install` from the command line. After that, be sure to specify a `db.json` file pointing to a PostgreSQL database (WIP). You're all set!

Add songs using `fz add`, list your library with `fz lib`, and view song spectrograms with `fz plot`. A full list of commands can be found using `fz -h`. Have fun!
